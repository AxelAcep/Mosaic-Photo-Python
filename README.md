Mosaic Photo Generator is a program that transforms an image into a visually stunning mosaic composed of smaller sample images. This tool is perfect for creating unique artworks or personalized designs. It offers customizable options for tile sizes, sample image collections, and final output settings. The program is optimized for performance, ensuring efficient processing even for high-resolution images.

The program divides the target image into smaller tiles and then resizes the sample images to fit each tile. Using advanced algorithms and a KDTree structure, it matches the average color of each sample image with the corresponding tile position, ensuring the final mosaic closely resembles the original image.

This project is ideal for photographers, artists, and anyone looking to explore creative ways to transform images. Try it out and let your creativity shine!
